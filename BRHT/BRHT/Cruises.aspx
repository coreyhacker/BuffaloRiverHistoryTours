Sip on refreshing cocktails from The River Queen and sample tasty hors d‘oeuvres  while cruising Lake Erie and the Buffalo River. Unlike our traditional tours, the Cocktail Cruise does not include a narrated tour, but a tour guide is available to answer any questions you may have. With an enjoyable playlist and a more casual set up, this cruise is the perfect occasion to gather with friends or co-workers after work. This 1 1/2 hour cruise is offered every Friday and Saturday evening during the month of September from 6:30- 8:00 pm. </p>
